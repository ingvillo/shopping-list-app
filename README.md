# shopping-list-app

This Shopping List App was designed and built from scratch while doing the Front End Development course at Thinkful. 

The basic requirements for this app were:
• Users should be able to enter items they need to purchase.
• Users should be able to check and uncheck items on the list (you don’t necessarily need to use checkboxes for this, but there should be a way of visually distinguishing between purchased and unpurchased items).
• Users should also be able to permanently remove items from the list.
